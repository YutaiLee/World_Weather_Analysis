# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview of project
Practice analysis, visualization, and statistics skills by retrieving and analyzing weather data for PlanMyTrip, a hypothetical travel company. The purpose of the project is to collect, analyze and visualize weather data in various cities around the world and provide travelers with a tool that enables them to determine their travel destination based on weather conditions.
### Results
According to the traveler's weather preferences, the traveler can determine potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. The map uses the pop-up marker on the marker layer map to display the destination.
